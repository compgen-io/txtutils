txtutils - utilities for manipulating text/tab delimited files
====

My goal is to have these programs:

view        - tab delimited file aware viewer
filter      - tab delimited file processing
merge       - merge two (sorted) tab delimited files

overlap     - find the overlap between text files
union       - find the union of text files
missing     - find the lines in one file, but not in another
venn        - calculate a 3 or 4 way Venn diagram (SVG output)
